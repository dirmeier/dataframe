=======================
The dataframe handbook
=======================

´´dataframe´´ is a Python libary for efficient computations for data in table-format, just like mySQL. I will step by step (i.e. version after version) include new functionalities to the ´´dataframe´´ package.Right now only grouping, modifying, aggegating and subsetting is supported. Sooner or later the library will be extended to C++.

Requirements
============

* Python 3
* scipy 0.18.0
* numpy 1.12.0
* nose 1.3.7
* sphinx 1.3.3
