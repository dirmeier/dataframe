The dataframe handbook
=======================

Large-scale data-analysis is getting increasingly important in statistics and
computer science. For matrix-shaped data-sets ``dataframe`` offers an easy to
use framework for analysis, reshaping and modification of data in Python.

``dataframe`` has a simple *API*, basic *grouping*, *aggregation*, *subsetting*
and *modification* functions. In the latest version ``dataframe`` offers
method piping as in the `unix`-commandline or `R`'s `magrittr` package.
