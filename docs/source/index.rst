=======================
The dataframe handbook
=======================

``dataframe`` is a Python libary for (yet only semi-) efficient computations for data-sets that are in table-format, just like a ``mySQL`` table. I will step by step (i.e. version after version) include new functionalities to the ``dataframe`` package. Right now only grouping, modifying, aggegating and subsetting is supported. Sooner or later the library will be extended to C++.

Requirements
============

* Python 3
* scipy 0.18.0
* numpy 1.11.0
* pytest 2.9.2
* sphinx 1.4.5
* scikit-learn 0.17.0
