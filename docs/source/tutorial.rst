The tutorial pages will explain how ``dataframe`` is used. The library exports two classes:

- DataFrame: basic class that represents your data,
- GroupedDataFrame: extension of ``DataFrame`` class with grouping information, i.e. rows are grouped into sets.

There are three ways to install the library. Either you can install directly from ``pip`` using:

.. code-block:: bash
 
   pip install dataframe

Alternatively just call:

.. code-block:: bash

The third option is two clone or download the repository and install with ``setup.py``, for example when you want to fork the library:
