Tutorial
========

The tutorial pages will explain how ``dataframe`` is used. The library exports two classes:

- DataFrame: basic class that represents your data,
- GroupedDataFrame: extension of ``DataFrame`` class with grouping information, i.e. rows are grouped into sets.

Installation
------------

Install the library using:

.. code-block:: bash
 
   pip install git+git://github.com/rafstraumur/dataframe.git

from command line. This will install the library in your local environment and gives you the newest *git commit*. You can of course also install using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install dataframe
